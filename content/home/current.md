**Julie Louvrier** (PhD 2015-2018) is evaluating and developing occupancy models for assessing the 
distribution of large carnivores in Europe (wolf, lynx). This is joint work with 
Christophe Duchamp and Eric Marboutin  from [ONCFS](http://www.oncfs.gouv.fr/) (France) and 
[John Linnell](https://nina.academia.edu/JohnLinnell) from NINA (Norway).

**Gilles Maurer** (PhD 2015-2018) is studying the interactions between the wild and 
semi-captive pools of Asian elephants within an interdisciplinary framework 
(demography, economy, ethno-ecology, population genetics) – check out the [NGO 
ElefantAsia](http://www.elefantasia.org/index.php/en/?lang=en). This is joint work with 
Baptiste Mulot from [Beauval Nature](http://www.beauvalnature.com/en/), 
Finn Kjellberg and Nicolas Lescureux from CEFE.

**Nina Santostasi** (PhD 2016-2019) is developing demographic models for studying hybridizing 
species. As case studies, she's considering dolphins in the Gulf of Corinth in Greece 
(with Giovanni Bearzi and Silvia Bonizzoni from [Dolphin Biology and 
Conservation](http://www.dolphinbiology.org/)) and wolves in Italy (with [Paolo 
Ciucci](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paolo_Ciucci) from University of Rome - 
La Sapienza).

**Hélène Labach** (PhD 2016-2019) from [GIS3M](https://www.gis3m.org/) is working on the 
conservation of bottlenose dolphins in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea. Her work 
relies on the data collected through the [GDEGeM project](https://www.gdegem.org/).

**Lorena Mansilla** (PhD 2016-2019) is developing demographic tools for social species with 
wolves, dolphins and elephant seals as case studies. She is using spatially-explicit 
capture-recapture models, social networks, cluster analyses and integrated population 
models.

**Tamar Lok** (post-doc 2015-2017) is developing integrated population models that combine 
colour-banding, tracking and count data to assess within- and between-individual 
variation in different aspects of migratory behaviour of the Eurasian Spoonbill and 
the Red Knot.

**Loreleï Guéry** (post-doc 2016-2018) is studying the dynamics of lynx populations in 
Switzerland using spatially-explicit capture-recapture models. This is joint work with 
[Fridolin Zimmermann](http://www.kora.ch/index.php?id=232&L=1) from KORA.

<img style="float:right;margin-left:5px;margin-top:15px;" src="/img/vincenzo.png">
**Vincenzo Gervasi** (post-doc 2017-2019) is using an interdisciplinary approach to 
understand coexistence patterns and build trans-boundary management tools for coexistence 
between large carnivores and human activities in Europe. This is joint work with [John 
Linnell](https://nina.academia.edu/JohnLinnell) from NINA (Norway) and 
[Luigi Boitani](http://bbcd.bio.uniroma1.it/bbcd/en/users/boitani-luigi) from 
University of Rome - La Sapienza.

**Valentin Lauret** (intern 2017) co-supervised with Julie Louvrier is working on the distribution
of wolves in France trying to account for species misidentification. This is joint work with 
Christophe Duchamp and Eric Marboutin  from [ONCFS](http://www.oncfs.gouv.fr/) (France).

**Marianne Coste** (intern 2017) co-supervised with Nicolas Lescureux from 
CEFE is studying the public perception of interactions between humans and dolphins.

**Guillaume Chero** (intern 2017) co-supervised with Claire Garrigue from 
[IRD](http://umr-entropie.ird.nc/index.php/team/claire-garrigue) and Roger Pradel 
is estimating the interval between two births in whales using capture-recapture models.
