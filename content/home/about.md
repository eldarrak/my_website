# About

I'm a [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/index.php) senior scientist at [CEFE](http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/) 
working at the interface of animal ecology, statistical modeling and social sciences. 
With students and colleagues, we focus on questions in ecology with the impact of climate 
change and human pressures on population dynamics and in conservation biology with the management 
of large mammals. I’ve recently become interested in human-wildlife interactions and how interdisciplinary 
approaches may 
contribute to the coexistence of humans and animals.

If you’d like to work with us, feel free to contact me. Also, check out 
[this paper](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23160641/my-pubs/boulet-publi2012AnCons.pdf) 
which gives the spirit of how we enjoy doing research.
