During the period 2013-2015, the [NGO GIS3M](https://www.gis3m.org/) led the 
[GDEGeM project](https://www.gdegem.org/) in which tons of data (on abundance 
and distribution among others) were collected on bottlenose dolphins.

We had a 1-day
seminar gathering participants to the project, local authorities, lay persons who came to
listen to the results of the projects. The talks can be seen 
[here](https://www.gdegem.org/presentations-restitution-resultats-projet-gdegem). I 
contributed by presenting our 
[abundance estimates](https://www.gis3m.org/sites/gis3m.org/files/doc/abondance_med_fr_gimenez_2016v2.pdf) 
and our new project on the 
[coexistence between dolphins and human activities](https://www.gis3m.org/sites/gis3m.org/files/doc/coexistence_gimenez_2016v2.pdf).
