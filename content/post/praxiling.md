We organized a meeting between our lab and [Praxiling](http://www.praxiling.fr/?lang=en) 
a lab working in linguistic to explore potential collaborations between ecology and linguistic. 
Marie Chandelier and I gave a talk on our recent results on a content analysis we 
performed on wolf recovery in France
and its coverage by newspapers. More soon on this front.
