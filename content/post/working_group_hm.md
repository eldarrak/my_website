Frederic Gosselin, Etienne Rivot and I organised a 2-day workshop on issues in 
fitting hierarchical models in ecology. I gave a talk on "Local minima and multistate 
capture-recapture models", slides and R code available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/multistate_local_minima).

The idea is to consider several problematic case studies and explore the issues using
several computing platforms (R, Jags, Nimble, Stan, Admb). Next meeting in May.
