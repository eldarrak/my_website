Isabelle Arpin, a sociologist from Grenoble, organised a 2-day seminar on interdisciplinarity 
in practice.

The idea was for the participants to share their experience in practicing 
interdisciplinarity. Coralie Mounet, Nicolas Lescureux and I gave a talk on our collaboration
on the attitude towards brown bears.
