I attended the [International Statistical Ecology Conference in 
Seattle](http://depts.washington.edu/uwconf/wordpress/isec2016/). I donâ€™t go often 
to conferences, but I do my best not to miss that one.

This 
year, clearly, hidden Markov models (HMM) were on the lips of everyone. Well, it was 
cool to realize that I wasn't too "has been" by giving a [1-day workshop on fitting 
occupancy models with HMM](http://depts.washington.edu/uwconf/wordpress/isec2016/workshops/) 
and program E-SURGE developed in our team. 

I also gave a talk on [the use of PCA to deal 
with many correlated covariated in capture-recapture models](http://tinyurl.com/jouhmle), 
and co-authored a talk that Ian Renner (see below) gave on [combining sources of 
information on species distribution](http://tinyurl.com/ztf2svo).
