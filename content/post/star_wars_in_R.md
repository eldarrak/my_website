I adapted two clever analyses made by others [here](http://evelinag.com/blog/2015/12-15-star-wars-social-network/#.WOZRgf2kJq5) 
and [here](http://varianceexplained.org/r/love-actually-network/). Check it out on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/ogimenez/200849). 
The data and R codes are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/starwars_network).
