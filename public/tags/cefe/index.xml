      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had our annual department day; for the occasion, we invited Anne-Caroline
Prévot. Anne-Caro is having a fascinating scientific pathway, as she started with a
PhD in bird population dynamics and now she’s working on topics requiring skills in
environmental psychology. Google her, you’ll see for yourself, her work is awesome.
For this special day, we opted for a particular format, with less science than usual,
the idea being to show what’s going on behind the scenes. We had a roundtable on the
link between research, managers and citizens. We also had several short unorthodox
talks where we tried to analyse why some of our papers/projects were successful,
but also why we failed at being read or funded. Interestingly,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/robresearchsite/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rob
Salguero-Gomez&lt;/a&gt;, a colleague of ours, wrote a nice piece on the topic
&lt;a href=&#34;http://decision-point.com.au/?article=why-academics-should-communicate-failure&amp;lang=fr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Last, we gathered several persons with various professional profiles so that our students
 could ask them all the questions they wanted. Overall, I think it went amazingly well,
 and all the attendees found something to take home with them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our team has recently joined the department Biodiversity &amp;amp; Conservation at CEFE, a
department that I have the pleasure to head now. We have moved offices and are now
on the second floor. I have an office with a brand new parquet floor and red walls
(that I chose and installed/painted myself, can you believe it?!). We had our
office-warming party early March. Do not hesitate to come by and visit our new
offices!&lt;/p&gt;
